abstract="Reward machines have recently been proposed as a means of encoding team tasks in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. The resulting multi-agent reward machine is then decomposed into individual reward machines, one for each member of the team, allowing agents to learn in a decentralised manner while still achieving the team task. However, current work assumes the multi-agent reward machine to be given. In this paper, we show how reward machines for team tasks can be synthesised automatically from an Alternating-Time Temporal Logic specification of the desired team behaviour and a high-level abstraction of the agents' environment. We present results suggesting that our automated approach has comparable, if not better, sample efficiency than reward machines generated by hand for multi-agent tasks.",

abstract="We present Pure-Past Action Masking (PPAM), a lightweight aproach to action masking for safe reinforcement learning. In PPAM, actions are disallowed (``masked'') according to specifications expressed in Pure-Past Linear Temporal Logic (PPLTL). PPAM can enforce non-Markovian constraints, i.e., constraints based on the history of the system, rather than just the current state of the (possibly hidden) MDP. The features used in the safety constraint need not be the same as those used by the learning agent, allowing a clear separation of concerns between the safety constraints and reward specifications of the (learning) agent. We prove formally that an agent trained with PPAM can learn any optimal policy that satisfies the safety constraints, and that they are as expressive as shields, another approach to enforce non-Markovian constraints in RL. Finally, we provide empirical results showing how PPAM can guarantee constraint satisfaction in practice.",

abstract="In this paper we investigate classes of finite partially ordered sets that are definable by non-nested formulas in conditional logic. We discuss examples of such definable classes and introduce the notion of a c-morphism between posets as a tool to show that a class of finite posets is not definable. Using an analogue of the Jankov-Fine formulas from modal logic, we show that a class of finite posets is definable by a set of formulas if and only if it is closed under c-morphic images. Lastly, we prove a Sahlqvist-like correspondence theorem stating that every class of finite posets that is definable by a formula without nested conditionals is also definable by a first-order formula.",

title="Maximally Permissive Reward Machines",
year="2024",
month="October",
booktitle="Proceedings of the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2024)",
abstract="Reward machines allow the definition of rewards for temporally extended tasks and behaviors. Specifying “informative” reward machines can be challenging. One way to address this is to generate reward machines from a high-level abstract description of the learning environment, using techniques such as AI planning. However, previous planning-based approaches generate a reward machine based on a single (sequential or partial-order) plan, and do not allow maximum flexibility to the learning agent. In this paper we propose a new approach to synthesising reward machines which is based on the set of partial order plans for a goal. We prove that learning using such “maximally permissive” reward machines results in higher rewards than learning using RMs based on a single plan. We present experimental results which support our theoretical claims by showing that our approach obtains higher rewards than the single-plan approach in practice.",

booktitle="Proceedings of the BPM Forum, co-located with BPM 2025 (to appear)",
abstract="In process management, effective behavior modeling is essential
for understanding execution dynamics and identifying potential issues.
Two complementary paradigms have emerged in the pursuit of this
objective: the imperative approach, representing all allowed runs of a
system in a graph-based model, and the declarative one, specifying the
rules that a run must not violate in a constraint-based specification. Ex-
tensive studies have been conducted on the synergy and comparisons of
the two paradigms. To date, though, whether a declarative specification
could be systematically derived from an imperative model such that
the original behavior was fully preserved (and if so, how) remained an
unanswered question. In this paper, we propose a three-fold contribu-
tion. (1) We introduce a systematic approach to synthesize declarative
process specifications from safe and sound Workflow nets. (2) We prove
behavioral equivalence of the input net with the output specification,
alongside related guarantees. (3) We experimentally demonstrate the
scalability and compactness of our encoding through tests conducted
with synthetic and real-world testbeds.",
