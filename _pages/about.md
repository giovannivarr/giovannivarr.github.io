I am a PhD student at [Utrecht University](uu.nl) under the supervision of [Brian Logan](https://alechina-logan.net/brian/) and [Mehdi Dastani](https://www.uu.nl/staff/mmdastani), in the [Intelligent Systems group](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/intelligent-software-systems/intelligent-systems).

My research lies at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Logic, focusing in particular on aspects concerning safety and sample efficiency.

[comment]: <> Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
